## What is Storyist?  

**Storyist** is an all-in-one environment for writers who value structure, creativity, and control over their storytelling process. It blends a clean, distraction-free editor with smart organizational tools, allowing authors to move effortlessly between inspiration and execution.  

At its heart, Storyist is built for **narrative design**. You can build complete stories from scratch — starting with a high-level outline, adding chapters, and expanding scenes as your ideas grow. With its **integrated corkboard view**, you can visualize your plot’s flow, reorder scenes with ease, and track how characters evolve throughout the story. Each project keeps your notes, drafts, and research materials organized in one place, ensuring that every creative element stays connected.  

Beyond simple text editing, Storyist supports **rich formatting, style sheets, and manuscript templates**. Whether you’re writing fiction, screenplays, or interactive scripts, the app provides the flexibility to fit your workflow. Writers can also attach images, reference documents, and location sketches to each scene — turning their project into a true story hub.  

The software includes **timeline and pacing tools**, helping you refine the structure of your story and balance emotional beats. For collaboration, Storyist works with **cloud synchronization** via iCloud or Dropbox, ensuring that your latest drafts are always accessible and secure. Built-in version control lets you revert to earlier edits or compare revisions side-by-side, so you never lose creative progress.  

For publishing and professional use, Storyist can **export to EPUB, PDF, DOCX, and Final Draft**, providing clean, industry-ready formats for editors, agents, or online platforms. Its performance remains smooth even with large manuscripts, making it a dependable companion for long-term writing projects.  

In short, Storyist empowers you to plan, write, and polish your story within one cohesive ecosystem — perfect for novelists, scriptwriters, or anyone transforming ideas into written form.
